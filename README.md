# k3s-homelab-gitops

This repository contains the **GitOps manifests** that define my self-hosted Kubernetes homelab.

All applications and infrastructure are deployed and managed through **Argo CD**, following a fully declarative approach.  
The stack includes components such as Traefik, Vault, Longhorn, cert-manager, and more, representing hands-on DevOps practices applied to real infrastructure.
